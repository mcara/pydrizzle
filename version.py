# python version tagger
#
# This file (version.py) is copied into every package that wants
# to store the subversion identifiers.  It lives at the top level of
# stsci_python.  If you are looking at this in some other directory
# (either lower in the hierarchy or in another package), you are looking
# at a copy.
#
# If you need to edit this file, edit the original in stsci_python, and then 
# copy it to these places:
#   stsci_python/multidrizzle/version.py 
#   stsci_python/pydrizzle/version.py    
#   stsci_python/pytools/version.py
#
# If you need to _use_ this file in your package, edit the list above to
# add your package, commit the changes, then copy the committed file into 
# your package.
#
# To use this file in your package, place this code in your setup.py file:
#
#   # gather our subversion information and save it; quit if that is all we need
#   import version
#   version.__set_svn_version__()
#   if "versiononly" in sys.argv[:2] :
#       sys.exit(0)
#
# After that, you can
#   # find out what subversion information applies to yourpackage
#   import yourpackage.svn_version
#   print yourpackage.svn_version.__svn_version__
#   print yourpackage.svn_version.__full_svn_info__
#
